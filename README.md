example 1.  worst case scenario: In the worst case, where the maximum element is at the end of the array or the array is sorted in descending order, it will require n - 1 comparisons. time complexity/big o notations: O(n)                                                                                                                                                       example 2.  worst case scenario: In the provided code, the worst-case scenario occurs when there are no duplicate elements in the array, and it needs to compare each element with every other element in the nested loops. time complexity/big o notations:O(n^2)                                                                                                              example 3.     worst case scenario: The worst-case scenario occurs when you have two square matrices A and B, each of size n x n, and you need to compute the resulting matrix C by performing n x n multiplications and additions time complexity/big o notations: O(n^3).                                                                                                 example 4.  worst case scenario: In the worst case, the code will execute the while loop until 'n' becomes 1. time complexity/big o notations: O(logâ‚‚(n))                                     example 5   worst case scenario:As 'n' grows larger, the worst-case scenario becomes increasingly# case-scenarios-
